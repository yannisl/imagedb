MADE BY EDWARD PALMER, IN NORTH CAROLINA, TENNESSEE, AND ARKANSAS.</h5>

<h4 class = "section"><a name = "intro" id =
"intro">INTRODUCTORY.</a></h4>

<p>Mr. Palmer began his explorations early in July, 1881, and continued
with marked success until the end of the year.</p>

<p>He first paid a visit to the Cherokee Indians of North Carolina, and
collected a large number of articles manufactured or used by this
people, besides a number of antiquities from the same region.</p>

<p>From Carolina he crossed into Tennessee, and began work by opening a
number of mounds in Cocke County. In September he opened a very
important mound, which I have named the McMahan Mound. It is located in
the vicinity of Sevierville, Sevier County. Afterwards mounds were
opened on Fain's Island, at Dandridge, and at Kingston.</p>

<p>In September he crossed into Arkansas and made extensive explorations
at Osceola, Pecan Point, Arkansas Post, and Indian Bay.</p>

<p>It has devolved upon the writer to examine and catalogue this fine
collection.</p>

<p>In preparing the catalogue the plan of arrangement already adopted by
the Bureau has been carried out; that is, a primary classification by
locality and a secondary by material.</p>

<p>The descriptions of specimens are taken from the card catalogue
prepared by the writer on first opening the collection, and will be
given in full, excepting in cases where detailed descriptions have been
furnished in separate papers, either in this or the preceding Annual
Report. Cuts have been made of a number of the more interesting
specimens. The localities are named in the order of their
exploration.</p>

ARTICLES OF STONE.</a></h6>

<p class = "hanging">
62953. A small disk of dark-gray slate, 1¼ inches in diameter and 1½
inches in thickness. The form is symmetrical and the surface well
polished. The sides are convex, slightly so near the center and abruptly
so near the circumference. The rim or peripheral surface is squared by
grinding, the circular form being accurately preserved. This specimen
was obtained from an aged Cherokee, who stated that it had formerly been
used by his people in playing some sort of game. It seems not improbable
that this stone has been used for polishing pottery.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62952. A small subglobular pebble used as a polishing stone for
pottery.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62954. A polishing stone similar to the above. This implement was seen
in use by the collector.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62947. A hemispherical stone, probably used as a nut-cracker.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62944. A stone implement somewhat resembling a thick, round-pointed
pick, 4½ inches in length and 1 inch in diameter. It is perforated
exactly as an iron pick would be for the insertion of a handle. The
perforation has been produced by boring from opposite sides; at the
surface it is five-eighths of an inch in diameter, and midway about
three-eighths. The material seems to be an indurated clay or soft
slate.</p>

<p>The collector suggests that this specimen was probably used for
smoothing bow-strings or straightening arrow-shafts.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62949. Eight arrow points of gray and blackish chalcedony.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62950. Pipe of gray, indurated steatite, of modern Cherokee
manufacture.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62951. Pipe of dark greenstone, highly polished. It is well modeled, but
of a recent type.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62888. Grooved ax of compact greenish sandstone; found near Bakersville,
N.&nbsp;C.</p>

ARTICLES OF CLAY.</a></h6>

<p>Obtained from the Southern Band of Cherokees, Jackson County, North
Carolina.</p>

<p>The manufacture of pottery, once so universally practiced by the
Atlantic coast Indians, is still kept up by this tribe, rather, however,
for
<span class = "pagenum">435</span>
<a name = "page435" id = "page435"> </a>
<!--png 583-->
the purpose of trade than for use in their domestic arts. The vessels
are, to a great extent, modeled after the ware of the whites, but the
methods of manufacture seem to be almost wholly aboriginal.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63070. A handled mug or cup of brownish ware. The form is not
aboriginal. It is composed of clay, tempered, apparently, with
pulverized shell. The surface has a slight polish produced by a
polishing implement. The height is 4½ inches and the width nearly the
same.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63068. Large flat-bottomed bowl, 6 inches in height, 11 inches in <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads 'diamter'">diameter</ins> at
the top, and 8 at the base. Although made without a wheel, this vessel
is quite symmetrical. The thickness is from one-fourth to one-half of an
inch. The material has been a dark clay paste with tempering of powdered
mica.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63066. A three-legged pot, with spherical body, resembling very closely
in appearance the common iron cooking pot of the whites. The rim is 6
inches in diameter, and 1 inch high. The body is 9 inches in diameter.
Two handles are attached to the upper part of the body. The form is
symmetrical and the surface highly polished. The polishing stone has
been used with so much skill that the effect of a glaze is well
produced. The materials used were clay and pulverized mica. The color is
dark brown.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63067. A strong, rudely made vessel shaped like a half cask. The walls
are about one-half an inch in thickness. The surface is rough, the
polishing stone having been very carelessly applied.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63068. A flat-bottomed bowl symmetrical in shape but rudely
finished.</p>

<h6><a name = "jackson_1_vegetal" id = "jackson_1_vegetal">
VEGETAL SUBSTANCES.</a></h6>

<p class = "hanging">
63063. Basket sieve said to be used to separate the finer from the
coarser particles of pounded corn. The coarse meal thus obtained is
boiled and allowed to ferment. This is used as food and is called
<i>connawhana</i>. The sieve is made of split cane carefully smoothed;
some of the strips are dyed red and others brown. A simple ornamental
design is worked in these colors. The opening is square, with rounded
corners, the sides measuring 14 inches. The depth is 5 inches. The
bottom is flat and loosely woven.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63072. A bottle-shaped basket, with constricted neck and rectangular
body, used by the Cherokees for carrying fish. Height, 11 inches; width
of mouth, 4 inches; diameter of body, 6 inches. It is made of strips of
white oak or hickory, one-fourth of an inch in thickness.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63073. Basket made of strips of white oak intended for the storage of
seeds and for other household uses. The rim is about 5 inches in
diameter; the body is 8 inches in diameter, the base being rectangular
and flat.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">436</span>
<a name = "page436" id = "page436"> </a>
<!--png 584-->

<p class = "hanging">
63074. Basket, made of cane, used for storing seed.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63076. Two baskets, made of cane, probably used for household purposes.
They are neatly ornamented with simple designs, produced by the use of
colored strips. The rims are oval in shape, and the bases rectangular.
The larger will hold about half a bushel, the smaller about a
gallon.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63077. Small basket with a handle, made of splints of white oak. Yellow
strips of hickory bark are used to ornament the rim. Other colors are
obtained by using bark of different trees, maple, walnut, etc.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63078. Small cup or dish carved from laurel or cucumber wood. It is very
neatly made. The depth is about 1 inch; the width 5 inches.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63064. Large spoon, carved from laurel or cucumber wood, used by the
Cherokees in handling the <i>connawhana</i>, or fermented meal. The
carving is neatly done. The heart-shaped bowl is 6 inches in length, 4
in width, and about 2 in depth. The handle is 12 inches long, and is
embellished at the end by a knob and ring. The knob is carved to
represent a turtle's or snake's head.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63065. A smaller spoon similar in shape to the above.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63087. A large, five-pronged fork carved from the wood of the
<i>Magnolia glauca</i> (?). It resembles the iron forks of the
whites.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63088. A small, three-pronged fork of the same pattern and material as
the above.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63080. A wooden comb made in imitation of the shell combs used by white
ladies for supporting and ornamenting the back hair. The carving is said
to have been done with a knife. Considerable skill is shown in the
ornamental design at the top. The wood is maple or beech.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63089. A walnut paddle or club, used to beat clothes in washing.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63059. Bow of locust wood, 5 feet long, one-half an inch thick, and 1½
inches wide in the middle, tapering at the ends to 1 inch. The back of
the bow is undressed, the bark simply having been removed. The string,
which resembles ordinary twine, is said to be made of wild hemp. The
arrows are 40 inches in length. The shafts are made of hickory wood and
have conical points. Stone and metal points are not used, as the country
abounds in small game only, and heavy points are considered unnecessary.
In trimming the arrow two feathers of the wild turkey are used; these
are close clipped and fastened with sinew.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63057. Blow-gun used by the Cherokees to kill small game. This specimen
is 7 feet in length, and is made of a large cane, probably the
<i>Arundinaria macrosperma</i>. These guns are made from 5 to 15 feet in
length, the diameter in large specimens reaching 1½ inches.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">437</span>
<a name = "page437" id = "page437"> </a>
<!--png 585-->

<p class = "hanging">
63058. Arrows used with the blow-gun. The shafts, which are made of
hickory wood, are 2 feet in length and very slender. The shooting end
has a conical point; the feather end is dressed with thistle-down, tied
on in overlapping layers with thread or sinew. The tip of down
completely fills the barrel of the gun; and the arrow, when inserted in
the larger end and blown with a strong puff, has a remarkable carrying
and penetrating power.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63085. Thistle-heads, probably the <i>Cnicus lanceolatus</i>, from which
the down is obtained in preparing the arrows of the blow-gun.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63061. Ball-sticks or racquets made of hickory wood. Rods of this tough
wood, about 7 feet long, are dressed to the proper shape, the ends
having a semicircular section, the middle part being flat. Each is bent
and the ends united to form a handle, leaving a pear-shaped loop 6
inches in width by about 12 in length, which is filled with a network of
leather or bark strings sufficiently close to hold the ball.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63061. Ball, 1½ inches in diameter, covered with buckskin, used with the
racquets in playing the celebrated ball game of the Cherokee, Choctaw,
Creek, and Seminole Indians.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63071. Shell, probably a <i>Unio</i>, used by potters to scrape the
surface of clay vessels; seen in use.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63081. Comb made of horn. The teeth are 2 inches in length, and have
been made with a saw. It is used in dressing the hair.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
63085. Charm made of feathers and snake rattles; worn on the head or on
some part of the costume.</p>

62752. Grooved ax, 8 inches in length, 3½ in width, and about 1 in
thickness; one side is quite flat, the other convex. The material is a
banded schistose slate.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62758. A fine specimen of grooved ax, 7 inches in length, 4 in width,
and 1½ in thickness. The groove is wide and shallow, and is bordered by
two narrow ridges, which are in sharp relief all the way around. The
material appears to be a greenish-gray diorite.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62759. A grooved ax, 6 inches long, 3½ inches wide, and 1 inch thick.
This specimen is similar to the preceding, the groove being deeper on
the lateral edges of the implement, and the upper end less prominent. It
is made of a fine-grained gray sandstone.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62753. Fragment of a grooved ax, of gray slate. The groove is shallow
and irregular.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62754. Celt of compact gray sandstone, somewhat chipped at the ends. It
is 6½ inches in length by 2½ in width and 1½ in thickness. One face is
flat, the other convex. The sides are nearly parallel. A transverse
section would be sub rectangular.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62755. Fragment of celt, 3 inches in length by 2 in width and about 1½
in thickness. The material is a fine grained sandstone or a diorite.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62756. A long, slender celt, very carefully finished, 7 inches in
length, 2 in width, and less than 1 in thickness. The material is a very
compact gray slate. It has apparently been recently used as a
scythe-stone by some harvester.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
62757. Fragment of a small, narrow celt, both ends of which are lost.

62870. The mound from which these fragments were obtained was located 3
miles from Newport. It was 12 feet square and 6 feet high. The original
height was probably much greater. The pottery was mixed with ashes and
<i>débris</i> of what appeared to be three fire-places. No human remains
were found. The fragments are not numerous, nor do they indicate a great
variety in form. There is, however, considerable variety in
decoration.</p>

gray in the mass, and is apparently quite siliceous or sandy, numerous
grains of quartz being visible. There is generally a sprinkling of
finely-powdered mica, but no shell matter can be detected. When much
weathered the surface is quite gritty.</p>

<p><i>Form.</i>&mdash;The leading form is a round-bodied, pot-shaped
vase. There is one small hemispherical bowl. The outlines have been
quite symmetrical. The mouths of the pots are wide, and the necks deeply
constricted. The lip or rim exhibits a number of novel features. That of
the larger specimen, of which a considerable segment remains, is
furnished on the upper edge with a deep channel, nearly one-half an inch
wide, and more than one-fourth of an inch deep. First section, <a href =
"#fig117">Fig.&nbsp;117</a>. Others have a peculiar thickening of the rim, a
sort of collar being added to the outside. This is about 1 inch in
width, and is thicker below, giving a triangular section. Third section,
<a href = "#fig117">Fig.&nbsp;117</a>.</p>

<p>The walls of the vessels are usually quite thin. The bottoms were
probably round, or nearly so. No fragments, however, of the lower parts
of the vessels were collected. There is but one example of handle, and
this presents no unusual features. Middle section, <a href =
"#fig117">Fig.&nbsp;117</a>.</p>

<p><i>Ornamentation.</i>&mdash;The ornamentation is in some respects
novel. The double or channeled rim of the larger specimen, the mouth of
which has been 13 or 14 inches in diameter, is embellished with a line
of flutings, which seem to be the impressions of a hollow bone or reed.
<span class = "pagenum">441</span>
<a name = "page441" id = "page441"> </a>
<!--png 589-->
The whole exterior surface is embellished with a most elaborate
ornamental design, which resembles the imprint of some woven fabric. If
a woven fabric has not been used, a pliable stamp, producing the effect
of a fabric, has been resorted to. The fact that the sharply concave
portions of the neck are marked with as much regularity as the convex
body of the vessel, precludes the idea of the use of a solid or
non-elastic stamp.</p>

<p>The pattern consists of groups of parallel indented lines, arranged
at right angles with one another, the puzzling feature being that there
is no evidence of the passing of the threads or fillets over or under
each other, such as would be seen if a woven fabric had been used. The
outer surface of the triangular collar peculiar to many of the pots has
been decorated with a herring-bone pattern, made by impressing a sharp
implement. The handle in one case is similarly ornamented. This handle
has been added <i>after</i> the figure previously described was
impressed upon the neck of the vessel. One small fragment shows another
style of indented or stamped pattern, which consists of series of
straight and curved lines, such as are characteristic of many of the
vessels obtained from the Gulf States.</p>

<p>A small fragment of coal-black ware is entirely smooth on the
outside, and indicates an unusually well finished and symmetrical
vessel. Another shows the impression of basket-work, in which a wide
fillet or splint has served as the warp and a small twisted cord as the
woof. One interesting feature of this vessel is that from certain
impressions on the raised ridges we discover that the vessel has been
taken from the net mold while still in a plastic state.</p>

<p>Still another reddish porous fragment has a square rim, which is
ornamented with a series of annular indentations.</p>

THE M<sup>c</sup>MAHAN MOUND.</a></h5>


<p>On the west fork of the Little Pigeon River, at Sevierville, on a
rich bottom, 125 yards from the river, is a celebrated mound, the owners
of which have for years refused to have it opened.</p>

<p>Mr. Palmer spent several days in trying to obtain permission to open
it, and was about leaving in despair, when the owners finally yielded,
not, however, without requiring a number of concessions on the part of
the collector, which concessions were put in the form of a legal
document.</p>

<p>This mound is 16 feet high and 240 feet in circumference.</p>

<p>Three feet below the surface, a stratum of burnt clay, 15 feet wide
by 30 long, was reached. This has probably formed part of the roof of a
dwelling.</p>

<p>Beneath this was a bed of charcoal 4 inches thick. In this bed
remnants of cedar posts from 2 to 4 inches thick and 1 to 2 feet in
length were found.</p>

<p>Below this was a stratum of ashes, covering a limited area to the
depth of 4 feet. Surrounding this, the earth contained fragments of
numerous articles used by the inhabitants, while beneath came 4½ feet of
earth, in which numerous skeletons had been deposited.</p>

<p>The bodies had been interred without order, and the bones were so
intermingled, and so far decayed, that no complete skeletons could be
collected. Beneath the layer of bones came a second deposit of ashes, 2
feet thick by 2½ feet in diameter, and beneath this a mass of red clay,
18 inches in thickness. In the earth surrounding the ashes and clay, a
number of skeletons were found; these were in such an advanced stage of
decomposition that only a few fragments of skulls could be
preserved.</p>

<p>Three feet below the second layer of bones, the undisturbed soil was
reached.</p>

<p>Two boxes of bones were collected, the well-preserved crania
numbering about twenty.</p>

<p>A great many interesting specimens of the implements, utensils, and
ornaments of the mound-builders were obtained.</p>

ARTICLES OF CLAY.</a></h6>

<p>The collection of pottery from this mound is of much interest. There
is but one entire vessel, but the fragments are so plentiful and well
preserved that many interesting forms can be restored, and a very good
idea of the ceramic work of this locality be formed.</p>

<p><i>Form.</i>&mdash;I have spent much time in the examination of these
fragments, and have assigned each to the form of vessel to which it
belonged. Where large pieces are preserved, especially if the rim is
included, we have little trouble in reconstructing the entire vessel,
without fear of being seriously wrong. The lower parts of the bodies of
all forms are round or slightly flattened, and but a small fragment of
the rim is needed to tell whether the vessel was a bottle, pot, or
bowl.</p>

<p>I find, however, that the forms merge into each other in such a way
that a complete graduated series can be found. Of first importance, are
the round or globular vases with more or less constricted necks.</p>

<p><i>Ornamentation.</i>&mdash;The inside of all forms is plain with the
exception of accidental markings of the fingers. The rim is square,
sharp, or round on the edge, and sometimes slightly enlarged or beaded
on the outer margin. A collar is attached to many forms, which at the
lower edge overhangs. It is added to the body with the rim, or as a
strip afterward
<span class = "pagenum">444</span>
<a name = "page444" id = "page444"> </a>
<!--png 592-->
attached. It is often notched or indented with a stick, bone, or reed,
or with the fingers.</p>

<p>The necks of vases and pot-shaped vessels have a great variety of
handles, knobs, and ornaments. Some of the latter seem to be atrophied
handles. In some cases a low horizontal ridge, from 1 to 4 or more
inches in length is placed near the rim, in place of the continuous
collar. In other cases a narrow, crescent-shaped ridge is attached, the
points reaching down on the shoulder, the arch lying upon the neck.
Still others have one or more handles which connect the rim with the
neck or shoulder of the vessel, leaving a round or oblong passage for a
cord or vine.</p>

<p>These handles were added after the vessel was completed. They are
never ornamented. In one case an arched handle, like the handle of a
basket, connects the opposite sides of the rim. This is the only entire
vessel recovered from the mound. It was associated with the upper layer
of skeletons. Diameter 4½ inches. <a href = "#fig118">Fig.&nbsp;118</a>.</p>

<p>The body of these vessels is sometimes quite plain, but is more
frequently covered with cord markings. These, with one or two
exceptions, seem to be made by a series of fine cords, approximately
parallel, but without cross-threads of any kind. There is little
uniformity of arrangement. In the upper part, and about the base of the
neck, the indented lines are generally vertical. On the bottom they are
quite irregular, as if the vessel, in making, had been rolled about on a
piece of netting or coarse cloth. The cords have been about the size of
the ordinary cotton cord used by merchants. One exception is seen in a
fragment of a large, rudely-made vase, in which we have the impression
of a fabric,
<span class = "pagenum">445</span>
<a name = "page445" id = "page445"> </a>
<!--png 593-->
the warp of which, whether wood or cord, has consisted of fillets more
than one-fourth of an inch in width, the woof being fine cord.</p>

<p>This is what is frequently spoken of as the ear-of-corn impression.
No incised or excavated lines have been noticed in these fragments of
pot-shaped vessels. Some of the most elegant vessels are without upright
necks. The upper or incurved surface of the body is approximately flat,
forming, with the lower part of the body a more or less sharp peripheral
angle. The base is rounded, and, so far as we can judge from the
examples, the bottom is slightly flattened. Vessels having vertical or
flaring rims are generally somewhat more shallow.</p>

<p>The incurved upper surface is often tastefully ornamented with
patterns of incised or excavated lines which are arranged in groups, in
vertical or oblique positions, or encircle the vessel parallel with the
border. One specimen has a row of stamped circles, made by a reed or
hollow bone.</p>

<p>Bowls of the ordinary shape are variously decorated. In one case we
have on the outside of the rim, and projecting slightly above it, a
rudely-modeled grotesque face. A notched fillet passes around the rim,
near the lip, connecting with the sides of this head.</p>

<p>In another case a rude node is added to the rim. The only bowl having
a flaring rim is without ornament.</p>

<p>We have only one fragment of a bowl in which the body has been marked
with cords.</p>

<p><i>Composition.</i>&mdash;The clay used in the pottery from this
mound is generally fine in texture, and of a light-gray color. Many of
the fragments have been blackened by burning subsequently to their
original firing, and some may have been originally blackened with
graphite. The prevailing colors seen in the fragments are yellowish and
reddish grays. The percentage of powdered shell used in tempering has
usually been very large, forming at times at least half the mass. The
flakes of shell are very coarse, being often as much as one-fourth of an
inch in diameter. In many cases they have been destroyed by burning, or
have dropped out from decay, leaving a deeply pitted surface.</p>

<p><i>Pipes.</i>&mdash;There are a number of pipes in the collection,
most of which were found near the surface of the mound. In some cases
they resemble modern forms very closely. The most striking example is
made of a fine-grained clay, without visible admixture of tempering
material. The color is a reddish gray. It is neatly and symmetrically
formed, the surface being finished by polishing with a smooth, hard
implement, and shaving with a knife. The bowl is 2 inches high, and the
rim is bell-shaped above, with a smooth, flat lip, one-fourth of an inch
wide. The diameter of the opening is nearly 2 inches. The base is
conical. The stem part is one-half an inch long and one-half an inch in
diameter. The bowl and stem are both conically excavated.</p>

<p>Another specimen is made of clay mixed with powdered shell. The bowl
is cylindrical, being a little larger at the rim, which is ornamented
<span class = "pagenum">446</span>
<a name = "page446" id = "page446"> </a>

with rows of punctures. The elbow is ornamented by a rosette of indented
lines. The mouth piece has been broken away.</p>

62797. One of the most instructive finds in this mound is a pair of
brass pins, of undoubted European manufacture. The collector makes the
statement, with entire confidence in its correctness, that they had been
encased in the earth at the time of the interment of the bodies. One was
associated with the upper and the other with the lower layer of bones.
In size and shape they resemble our ordinary brass toilet pin. The head
is formed of a spiral coil of wire, the diameter of which is about
one-half that of the shaft of the pin. It is also stated by the
collector that an iron bolt was found in the lower stratum of bones.
This object was unfortunately lost.</p>

<p>Few mounds have rivaled this in its wealth of shell ornaments.
Engraved gorgets cut from the body of the <i>Busycon perversum</i> and
large pins from the columellæ of the same shell are especially numerous
and well-preserved. Large numbers of beads and unworked shells were also
found. All were intimately associated with the skeletons.</p>

<p>While many of the specimens are well-preserved, we find that many are
in an advanced stage of decay, and unless most carefully handled,
crumble to powder.</p>

<p>Similar shell ornaments are found in mounds in other parts of
Tennessee, as well as in neighboring States. These have been pretty
fully described in the Second Annual Report.</p>

62830-62839. These pins are all made from the <i>Busycon perversum</i>.
The entire specimens range from 3 to 6 inches in length; two are
fragmentary, having lost their points by decay. The heads are from
one-half to 1 inch in length, and are generally less than 1 inch in
diameter. They are somewhat varied in shape, some being cylindrical,
others being conical above. The shaft is pretty evenly rounded, but is
seldom symmetrical or straight. It is rarely above one-half an inch in
diameter, and tapers gradually to a more or less rounded point. The
groove of the canal shows distinctly in all the heads, and may often be
traced far down the shaft. In a number of cases the surface retains the
fine polish of the newly finished object, but it is usually somewhat
weathered, and frequently

discolored or chalky. These specimens were found in the mounds along
with deposits of human remains, and generally in close proximity to the
head; this fact suggests their use as ornaments for the hair.</p>

62840-62843. A number of saucer-shaped shell gorgets, the upper edge
being somewhat straightened, the result of the natural limit of the body
of the shell. Two small holes, for suspension occur near the upper
margin. The diameter ranges from 3 to 6 inches.</p>

<p>In studying the design the attention is first attracted by an
eye-like figure near the left border. This is formed of a series of
concentric circles, and is partially inclosed by a looped band about
one-eighth of an inch in width, which opens downward to the left. This
band is occupied by a series of conical dots or depressions, the number
of which varies in the different specimens.
<span class = "pagenum">448</span>
<a name = "page448" id = "page448"> </a>

The part of the figure inclosed by this band represents the head and
neck of the serpent. To the right of the eye we have the mouth, which is
usually shown in profile, the upper jaw being turned upward exhibiting a
double row of notches or teeth. The body encircles the head in a single
coil, which appears from beneath the neck on the right, passes around
the front of the head, and terminates at the back in a pointed tail
armed with well-defined rattles. The spots and scales of the serpent are
represented in a highly conventionalized manner.</p>

as to suggest their use as ornaments for the head or neck. There are,
however, no holes for suspension except those made to represent the
eyes, and these, so far as I have observed, show no abrasion by a cord

used as masks, after the manner of metal masks by some of the oriental

<p>A few specimens of potsherds were collected from the fields about
Sevierville.</p>

<p>Most of these are identical in every way with the pottery of the
mound, but three examples are of a totally different type. The material
of these is a fine sandy clay, tempered with a large percentage of
finely pulverized mica.</p>

<p>The forms of the vessels cannot be made out. The outer surfaces were
ornamented by a stamped pattern of small square or lozenge-shaped
figures, a number of these together were apparently formed by a single
stamp.</p>

<p>Among the fragments we have half a dozen disks, from 1 to 2 inches in

of a bird was also found with these fragments. There were also masses of
indurated clay, which seem to have been used for chinking purposes.</p>

MOUND AT TAYLOR'S BEND.</a></h5>

<p>This mound is situated three hundred and fifty yards from the French
Broad River, on the farm of Mr. William Harris.</p>

<p>It is 10 feet high and nearly 50 feet in circumference. Its summit
has been cultivated for many years, and the height has doubtless been
much reduced. Immediately under the surface soil a heavy bed of ashes
and charcoal was reached, which at the border of the mound was only a
few inches thick, but at the center was about 3 feet thick.</p>

<p>In this stratum were found a few implements, and fragments of
pottery, and two very much decayed skeletons. A part of one cranium was
preserved. The mound beneath this stratum was composed chiefly of loam,
with some sand in the center, and contained nothing of interest.</p>

MOUNDS NEAR PAINT ROCK FERRY.</a></h5>

<p>About three hundred yards from the Tennessee River, at Paint Rock

about two acres.</p>

<p>Permission could not be obtained to open the mound, on account of the
crop of corn that covered it. Near its base, on opposite sides, were two
smaller mounds. One of these was 5 feet high and 10 in diameter, and
contained a stone grave. The body which it contained had been laid on
the ground and covered a foot deep with earth. A flat rock had been laid
upon this, and slabs of limestone set on edge all around. The inclosed
space was 4 feet in width by 5 in length. Earth had been used to cover
the cist and form the mound.</p>

<p>About this mound were scattered many slabs of stone which had been
plowed up during previous years; and it is stated that human bones and
various objects of art have, at different times, been brought to

MOUND ON FAIN'S ISLAND.</a></h5>

<p>This mound is located on the east end of the island. Although it has
been under cultivation for many years, it is still 10 feet in height.
The circumference at the base is about 100 feet. Near the surface a bed
of burned clay was encountered, in which were many impressions of poles,
sticks, and grass. This was probably the remains of the roof of a house,
which had been about 16 feet long by 15 feet in width. The bed of clay
was about 4 inches thick. Beneath this was a layer of charcoal and
ashes, with much charred cane. There were also indications of charred
posts, which probably served as supports to the roof. Four feet below
the surface were found the remains of thirty-two human skeletons. With
the exception of seventeen skulls, none of the bones could be preserved.
There seems to have been no regularity in the placing of the bodies.</p>

ARTICLES OF CLAY.</a></h6>

<p>The fragments of pottery from this mound are unusually large and well
preserved, and exhibit a number of varieties of form and
ornamentation.</p>

<p><i>Forms.</i>&mdash;The prevailing form is a pot-shaped vase, with
wide mouth, and rounded body; the neck is short and straight or but
slightly constricted. The handles or ears which connect the upper part
of the neck with the shoulder are in some cases as much as 3 inches
wide. The bowls are mostly hemispherical, but in a few cases have
incurved lips, the shoulder being rounded and the base somewhat
flattened. The largest specimens have been 11 or 12 inches in diameter.
The vases have been <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads 'somwhat'">somewhat</ins> larger.</p>

<p><i>Material.</i>&mdash;Classified by material, there seem to be two
varieties, one with a very large percentage of coarsely pulverized shell
material, the other without visible <i>dégraissant</i>. The clay is
usually fine and apparently without admixture of sand or other
impurities. A little comminuted mica may be seen in some cases.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;The prevailing color is a reddish gray, more or
less blackened by use. A remarkable variety has a bright red surface,
the mass being gray.</p>

<p><i>Ornamentation.</i>&mdash;The ornamentation consists of cord and
net impressions, incised lines, stamped figures, indented fillets, and
life and fanciful forms modeled in relief.</p>

<p>The study of cord impressions is quite interesting. The cords are
twisted and as large as medium twine. These cords appear to have
<span class = "pagenum">464</span>
<a name = "page464" id = "page464"> </a>
<!--png 612-->
been disconnected, at least, not woven into a fabric, and the
impressions are generally nearly vertical about the upper part of the
vessel, but below take all positions, the result being a sort of
hatching of the lines. This effect may be the result of placing the
vessel upon a coarse fabric while the rim was being finished or the
handles added.</p>

<p>It seems possible that a loose net of cords, probably with fine
crossthreads, is used to suspend the vessel in during the process of
modeling. It appears, however, if this has been the case, that the
vessel has been taken out of this net before it was burned. Where
handles have been added, it will be found that the cord markings have
been destroyed by the touch of the fingers. But the body has impressions
of the net made after the addition of the handles and ornaments, as the
impressions appear on the outside or lower edges of these additions. The
lower part of the body may still have been supported by the net during
the process of drying; but as some vessels have no cord markings
whatever, it is evident that it was not difficult to complete the vessel
without the support of the net.</p>

<p>By making a clay impression of one of the fragments I have been able
to determine the character of the fabric used. It was loosely woven and
quite flexible, the clay often receiving finger impressions through it.
It was probably made of grasses or the fibre of bark.</p>

<p>Beside the net and cord marks, which may or may not be the result of
an attempt at ornament, there are ornaments made of fillets of clay. In
a number of cases a comb-like figure made of thin fillets has been added
to the shoulder of a vase. In other cases a fillet has been carried
around the neck of the vase and indented by the finger or an
implement.</p>

<p>The rim of one bowl has been ornamented with three deeply incised or
excavated lines, which form a sort of embattled figure about the
incurved lip. Another has a series of shallow, vertical, incised lines
near the rim, and a circle of annular indentations, three-eighths of an
inch in diameter, about one-fourth of an inch from the lip.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">465</span>

<!--png 613-->
There are also various forms of noded ornaments on the rims of bowls.
The handles of vases are in a few cases effectively ornamented. In one
case the handle has been elaborated into a life form, representing a
frog or human figure. The arms are attached to the upper part of the
handle and lie extended along the rim. The handle proper represents the
body, the breast being protruded. The legs lie flattened out upon the
shoulder of the vessel, the feet being bent back beneath the body;
height 3½ inches. This vessel is illustrated in

another incised circle, about 1¼ inches in diameter, which incloses the

PEMISSCOTT MOUND.</a></h5>

<p>On Pemisscott Ba<ins class = "correction" title =

Samuel Hector, is a mound 20 feet in height, with a surface area of
about one-fourth of an acre. The sides have been dug into extensively,
but the central part remained untouched. It was composed of sand and
bluish clay, but contained no remains of interest. It is stated by the
proprietor that formerly there were three circular ditches extending
around the slopes of the mound. When the surface of the mound was first
plowed quantities of charcoal and potsherds were found.</p>

<p>Collectors had already done much work on this mound, but obtained
little or nothing. The owner does not wish it disturbed further. A field
of several acres near by abounds in fragments of pottery, stone
implements, and the remains of houses and camp-fires.</p>

<p>The field contained originally many small mounds or heaps, which were
probably the sites of houses. In a number of cases skeletons have been
found beneath these heaps.</p>

MOUNDS IN CARSON LAKE TOWNSHIP.</a></h5>

<p>In Carson Lake township, 6 miles southwest of Osceola, on the farm of
Hugh Walker, are three mounds, which were much disturbed by the
earthquake that visited the New Madrid district in 1811.</p>

<p>The first one inspected is 59 feet wide by 75 feet long, but exhibits
no evidence of having been a dwelling or burial place.</p>

<p>The second mound is about 100 yards from the first, and is circular
in outline, having two ridge-like projections from opposite sides. It is
20 feet in height, and about 23 feet across at the top. A number of
recent interments have been made near the summit.</p>

<p>The third mound is 250 yards from the preceding, and is 6 feet high,
34 feet wide, and 35 feet long. Six skeletons were found in this mound.
A stratum of ashes, charcoal, and burned clay was associated with them.

MOUNDS AT PECAN POINT.</a></h5>

<p>On the land of R.&nbsp;W. Friend, 1 mile west of the Mississippi

feet in circumference. The other is 4 feet high and 75 feet in
circumference. Two skeletons were found near the surface of the latter
mound.</p>

<p>Near these mounds is another, 4 feet high and 20 feet in diameter.
Formerly this mound was covered with large trees, and the roots have
penetrated the soil, causing much injury to the contents. It is the
opinion of the collector that this mound, as well as many others of the
same region, has been used as a dwelling site, and that when a death
occurred the dwelling was burned down over the body. Before building
again the site was covered with a few inches of earth. There was no
uniformity in the position of the graves or their contents. The
following objects were obtained from this mound:</p>

ARTICLES OF CLAY.</a></h6>

<p>Near the middle of the connecting ridge, just under the soil, a layer
of burnt clay, about 5 or 6 feet in diameter, was found. At one side,
imbedded in the <i>débris</i> of clay, a large quantity of fragments of
earthen vessels was discovered. They comprise a number of bowls of
various sizes, which are all quite new-looking, and are of a type of
ware quite distinct from that found in the fields and graves of the same
locality. Restorations of a large number have been made, and the
collection proves to be extremely interesting.</p>

<p>The collector argues, from the position of the fragmentary vessels,
that they had been placed by their owners upon the roof of the house,
which, he surmises, was destroyed by fire.</p>

63040, 63034, 63170, 63421, 65412, 65409, 65422, 65405. Plain bowls of
yellowish-gray ware, restored from fragments described above. They are
wide and shallow, and somewhat conical below; hand-made, and without
polish. Composed of clay, tempered with pulverized shell. The walls are
usually quite thin. Diameter 10 to 13 inches. Height 3 to 6 inches.</p>

FIELD GRAVES NEAR MENARD MOUND.</a></h5>

<p>Surrounding the Menard mound is a field containing about twenty
acres, which appears at one time to have been the site of a great number
of dwellings, as, at a depth of from 1 to 2 feet, layers of burned clay
are found. This field seems also to have been a great cemetery, as the
remains of skeletons are found in great numbers.</p>

<p>Pottery is found in great abundance. It has, as a rule, been
deposited near the heads of the dead, but no ornaments or implements
have been discovered with the remains. The frequent plowing of the field
has destroyed many earthen vessels, the interments having been made
quite near the surface. It is a noticeable fact that the pottery from
these graves is of a character quite distinct from that of the mound. It
is of the class of ware so common in this region.</p>

<p>Few facts in regard to them have been furnished, excepting that they
were taken from graves in the vicinity of Charleston, Mo. They resemble
so closely the well-known types of Missouri pottery that it is safe to
conclude that they were obtained from ancient graves and mounds in the
locality named.</p>

<p>The numerous cuts accompanying this section are intended for
subsequent use in a general treatise on the works of the
Moundbuilders.</p>

<p>This ware is generally of the dark gray or black variety,
handsmoothed, or but slightly polished, and tempered with pulverized
shells.</p>

<p>A few examples are yellowish-red in color. Some of these have been

frequently high and slender, and the body globular or subglobular. The
base is nearly always slightly flattened.</p>

<p class = "hanging">

COLLECTION FROM PERU, SOUTH AMERICA.</a></h4>

<p>A number of interesting articles were presented by Mr. G.&nbsp;H.
Hurlbut. These were obtained from ancient graves in the vicinity of Lima
by an agent sent out for the purpose by Mr. Hurlbut while the city was
invested by the Chilian army. Details of their occurrence were
consequently not obtained.</p>

<p>A study of this collection leads to the belief that all the specimens
are from one interment, that is, the grave of a single individual. The
fact that there is but one skull, one mask-like idol, and but a small
number of articles of each, of the classes represented, tends to confirm
this supposition.</p>

65376. A mask-like wooden figure, the face being somewhat above
life-size. <a href = "#fig198">Fig.&nbsp;198</a>. It is of a form not unusual
in Peruvian graves. The features are fairly well shown. The eyes are
formed by excavating oval depressions and setting in pieces of shell.
First, oval pieces of white clam-shell are inserted, which represent the
whites of the eye; upon these small circular bits of dark shell are
cemented, representing the pupils. Locks of hair have been set in
beneath the shell, the ends of which project, forming the lashes of the
eye.</p>

<p>The back head is formed by a neatly-rounded bundle of leaves, held in
place by a net-work of coarse cord. The edges of the wooden mask are
perforated in several places; by means of these the back head, some long
locks of fine flax which serve as hair, and a number of other articles
have been attached.</p>

<p>Upon the crown a large bunch of brilliantly colored feathers has been
fixed; behind this, extending across the top of the head, is a long
pouch of coarse white cloth in which a great number of articles have
been placed&mdash;little packages of beans and seeds, rolls of cloth of
different colors and textures, minute bundles of wool and flax and
cords, bits of copper and earth carefully wrapped in husks, bundles of
feathers, etc.</p>

<p>Encircling the crown are long, narrow bands or sashes, one of which
is white, the others having figures woven in brilliant colors. The ends
of these hang down at the sides of the face. Attached to one side of the
mask by long stout cords is a pouch of coarse cotton cloth resembling a
tobacco-bag. It is about 6 inches square. Attached to the lower edge of
this is a fringe of long, heavy cords. To the opposite side a
<span class = "pagenum">509</span>

net is suspended, in which had been placed innumerable articles,
probably intended for the use of the dead&mdash;a sling, made of cords,
very skillfully plaited; bundles of cord and flax; small nets containing
beans, seeds, and other articles; copper fish-hooks, still attached to
the lines, which are wound about bits of cornstalk or cane; neatly-made
sinkers wrapped in corn-husks, together with a variety of other
articles.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
